    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>The first time I had these were at a very cute upscale Breakfast/Brunch Inn.<br>
    Went home that very day and began recreating the amazing experience I had just had and <br>
    I've come up with the following masterpiece!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>  
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red food coloring</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the cream cheese glaze by beating the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth.<br>
            Thin with 1 tablespoon milk or as needed to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Whisk the flour, white sugar, baking powder, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside.<br>
            Beat the eggs in a separate mixing bowl until smooth. Whisk in 1/4 cup milk with the buttermilk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, vinegar, and food coloring. <br>
            Stir in the flour mixture until moistened. Drizzle in the melted butter, and stir until the butter has incorporated and small lumps of flour remain.</li>
    
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry.<br> 
            Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. Drizzle with the cream cheese glaze to serve.</li>
    </ol>
